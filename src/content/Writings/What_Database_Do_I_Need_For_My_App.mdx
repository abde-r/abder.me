#### How Many Types of Databases Are There?

There are nearly a dozen types of databases. Some of the more commonly used categories of databases include: 

&nbsp;<strong> * Hierarchical Databases: </strong> The hierarchical database looks similar to a family tree. A single object (the ‚Äúparent‚Äù) has one or more objects beneath it (the ‚Äúchild‚Äù). No child can have more than one parent. In exchange for the rigid and complex navigation of the parent-child structure, the hierarchical database offers high performance, as there‚Äôs easy access and a quick querying time. The Windows Registry is one example of this system.

&nbsp;<strong> * Relational Databases: </strong> This database commonly uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data. This database stores data in discrete tables, which can be joined together by fields known as foreign keys. For example,  you might have a User table that contains data about your users, and join the users table to a Purchases table, which contains  data about the purchases the users have made. MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle are examples.


&nbsp;<strong> * Non-Relational Databases: </strong> Non-relational management systems are commonly referred to as¬†NoSQL databases. This type of database matured due to increasingly complex modern web applications. These databases' varieties have proliferated over the last decade. Examples include MongoDB and Redis.

&nbsp;<strong> * Object oriented databases: </strong> Object oriented databases store and manage objects on a database server's disk. Object oriented databases are unique because associations between objects can persist. This means that object oriented programming and the querying of data across complex relationships is fast and powerful. One example of an object oriented database is MongoDB Realm, where the query language constructs native objects through your chosen SDK. Object oriented programming is the most popular programming paradigm.

#### SQL vs NoSQL

SQL is used for querying relational databases, where data is stored in rows and tables that are linked in various ways.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Scalability: Most SQL databases are vertically scalable...

&nbsp;&nbsp; Structure: SQL database schema organizes data in relational, tabular ways...

&nbsp;&nbsp; MySQL, PostgresSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server...

NoSQL is a non-relational database, meaning it allows different structures than a SQL database (not rows and columns) and more flexibility to use a format that best fits the data.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Scalability: NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable...

&nbsp;&nbsp; Structure: NoSQL databases are not relational...
